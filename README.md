# 112rraria
My 15-112 Term Project, a Python-based sandbox game inspired by Terraria

### Notes: 

A guide on how to play is written under the options button. I was going to have actual options, but I ran out of ideas on what to implement there. 

Anything with the word "test" in the filename was just a short file used for debugging, and not something to be graded. I mean, you can look at them anyway. I can't stop you.

For a better experience (on laptops), please plug in your computer to wall power. If the game still lags, press 'f' to ~~pay respects~~ turn on fast mode. If the game still lags after that, maybe consider an upgrade.

All blue rectangles in this game are works of fiction. Any resemblance to real blue rectangles, alive or dead, is purely coincidental.
