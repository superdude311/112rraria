# 112rraria
My 15-112 Term Project, a Python-based sandbox game inspired by Terraria

To Run: Download all files + run main.py

### Notes: 

A guide on how to play is written under the options button. I was going to have actual options, but I ran out of ideas on what to implement there. 

Anything with the word "test" in the filename was just a short file used for debugging, and not something to be graded. I mean, you can look at them anyway. I can't stop you.

For a better experience (on laptops), please plug in your computer to wall power. If the game still lags, press 'f' to ~~pay respects~~ turn on fast mode. If the game still lags after that, maybe consider an upgrade. (Do note, however, that the screen moves in integer-tile steps, so it may look a little jittery even if running smooth. I would've implemented an FPS counter, but I couldn't think of how to do it)

All blue rectangles in this game are works of fiction. Any resemblance to real blue rectangles, alive or dead, is purely coincidental.
